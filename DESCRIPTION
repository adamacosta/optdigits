Description: Authors used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract
  normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of
  43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set.
  32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on
  pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where
  each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and
  gives invariance to small distortions.
